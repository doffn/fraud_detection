   - Target balance ratio: 70:30 (legitimate:fraud)

2. **Random Undersampling**
   - Reduce majority class size
   - Maintain all fraud examples
   - Risk: Information loss from legitimate transactions

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine SMOTE with edited nearest neighbors
   - Clean overlapping examples
   - Optimize boundary definition

#### 5.2.2 Algorithm-Level Solutions
1. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**

   - Suitable for tree-based algorithms

2. **Threshold Optimization**
   - Adjust classification threshold based on business cost
   - Optimize for F1-score or AUC-PR
   - Balance precision and recall

#### 5.2.3 Evaluation Strategy
